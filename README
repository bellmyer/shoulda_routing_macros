Shoulda Routing Macros
====================

This is a simple plugin I plan to combine with my other macros to create a package at a later date.


Examples
========

If your route is:

    map.resources :checkens do |chickens|
      chickens.resources :eggs
    end

Then your tests should be:

    should_map_resources :chickens
    should_map_nested_resources :chickens, :eggs

If you have a singlton resource:

    map.resource :one_model_to_rule_them_all

Then your test will look very similar:

    should_map_resource :one_model_to_rule_them_all

It's fairly intuitive, but I'll add more documentation later.
